# Calibrating

## Overview

mindpowers does one loop: shape, draft, review, and remembers what you like. This skill is the "remember" step, and the only one that writes `docs/mindpowers/preferences.md`. `mindstorming` step 1 reads that file before it starts a new session, so what gets recorded here shapes every future spec of that template type.

This is a light skill. Don't turn it into an interrogation: most of the time there are 1-3 short questions and one write.

## Process

1. **Identify what this is about.** Figure out which spec/draft the feedback concerns. Scan `docs/mindpowers/specs/` and `docs/mindpowers/drafts/` for a matching topic or recent file; if it's genuinely ambiguous, ask which one. Note its template `type`: preferences are filed under that type.
2. **Ask at most 3 questions**, skipping any already answered by what the user just said:
   - What landed: what worked and should happen again?
   - What got cut or rewritten by a human: where did the draft miss?
   - What should change next time?
3. **Distill into 1-3 one-line preference entries.** Short, concrete, reusable, not a summary of the conversation.
4. **Show the entries and get approval before writing.** Let the user edit the wording.
5. **Append to `docs/mindpowers/preferences.md`** under the matching template's section.

## preferences.md format

Markdown, sectioned by template type, each section a flat bullet list of dated one-liners:

```markdown
<!-- Read by mindstorming step 1. Written only by calibrating. -->

## business-review
- 2026-07-07: audience is CPO not VP, default audience field accordingly
- 2026-03-12: prefers UK spelling

## decision-doc
...

## general
- 2026-01-20: keep recommendations to one sentence, always up front
```

Sections match the 8 template types (`business-review`, `decision-doc`, `prd`, `briefing-doc`, `comms-draft`, `framework`, `talking-points`, `post-mortem`) plus `general` for anything cross-cutting. If the file doesn't exist, create it with the header comment above and only the section(s) you're writing to, no need to pre-populate all 9.

## Rules

- **Never record sensitive content.** If feedback is political ("X didn't like the framing"), generalize it to a role ("the exec sponsor preferred a shorter framing"), not a name.
- **Prune on write.** If a new entry contradicts an older one in the same section, replace the old line rather than appending a second one that disagrees with it.
- **Cap each section at ~10 bullets.** If a write would push a section over that, merge overlapping entries or drop the stalest one. If it's unclear which to drop, ask the user rather than guessing.
- Keep entries short, one line each. This file gets read at the start of every mindstorming session; it should stay skimmable.

## Cowork / no-filesystem fallback

Paths above are relative to the working folder; in Cowork that's the user's shared folder. If no writable folder exists, show the proposed entries in chat and say plainly they weren't saved, since there's nowhere for the next session to read them from either.
